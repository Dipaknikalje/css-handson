      <li>
        CSS describe How elements are to be displayed on screen, paper or in
        other area
      </li>
      <li class>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through"><strong>CSS is not necessary</span>
        CSS saves a lot of work.</strong> It can controle the multiple web pages at once

    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways</h2>

    <div class="text">
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Inline- By using the style attribute inside html elements 1</li>
        <li>Internal- By using the style element in the head section</li>
        <li>
          External- By using link element to link to an external css file.
        </li>
        <li>
          The most common way to add css, is to keep the styles in external css
          files. However,
          <span><strong> In this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</strong></span>
          because This is easier to Demonstrate and easier for you to try it
          yourself.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a
      style to multiple elements. ID on the other hand, applies a style to one
      unique element. ID is also special you can use a special URL to link
      directly to an element and its used by Javascript.
    </p>
    <p>
      In css selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
      elements on a web page. Once an element has been targetted a style or set
      of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly
      used are class and ID. both are used to target elements which a style
      should be applied.
